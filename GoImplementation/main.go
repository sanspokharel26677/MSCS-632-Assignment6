/*
=========================================
Go Data Processing System
=========================================
This Go program simulates a multi-threaded data processing system using goroutines and channels.
It creates a set of worker goroutines that pull tasks from a shared task channel, process them
(simulated with a delay), and log the result into an output file.

Concurrency is handled using channels for task distribution and a mutex for synchronized file writing.
Graceful shutdown and error handling are also implemented to ensure thread-safe execution.
